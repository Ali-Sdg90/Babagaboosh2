Those were all the items you needed to enter Darkness's bedroom to try to capture him. But you could still go anywhere in the land of darkness. What would you like to do next?",

Maybe I can even find some other tools or tricks I can use to capture Darkness, or maybe I'll find out more about why he really hates the light. I just hope I don't run into any more creepy crawlies or other scary things... It just makes me feel *heeeeoooooeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeheuuuuuughhhhahaahaha*.",

There's Darknesses house, which has the dancing furniture and the chemistry set. But at the top of darkness is house, is darkness, is room where you could capture darkness. Now what would you like to do?",

It sounds like there might be some useful items or instructions in there that I can use to help me on my mission. Plus, if I can observe how the furniture boogies down, maybe I can strategize how to use their moves to defeat Darkness! Onward Poggies!",

You also visited the chemistry set and you can check out some of those recipes if you would like, such as invisibility or anti gravity. You could also go back to the mines or the tic-tac-toe park, or head up to Darknesses room in order to finally capture darkness now that you have all three of your missing items recovered. What would you like to do?",

I'm not sure if I need it to capture Darkness since I have all of my gear back, but it could be fun to test it out and have some mischief in the Land of Darkness! I'll just make a mental note of that for now.\n\nBut, let's cut to the chase: I'm tough, I'm ready, and I'm fired up to capture Darkness! I think it's time to climb Darkness's house and confront him in his room. Here goes nothing! *heeeeoooooeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeheuuuuuughhhhahaahaha*",

It could be trouble to deal with some dankest clothes. Maybe Darkness has some nifty costumes that I can try on for camouflage, or even an outfit with ultraviolet vision to enhance my sight in the dark. Here goes nothing, let's see what's inside that closet!",

I should check it out first before leaving this room. Maybe there's a book on lock-picking, a key I can use, or a mirror that can reflect light to help me see the lock's tumblers better. Let's investigate that shelf!",

Now I have a better chance of finding the right one to unlock the closet door. \n\nAlright, let's do some testing to see which key is a perfect fit for the closet door. I'll try all of the full-sized keys first, making sure to eliminate the ones that don't fit properly as I go. Finally, when only a handful of keys remain, I'll test them out one by one until I find the right one. And if none of these keys fit, I'll *heeeeoooooeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeheuuuuuughhhhahaahaha* and look for other items that could help me cracking open the closet lock.  \n\nBut first, let's see if that one key that didn't fall out of the shelf fits the lock. If not, I'll move to the pile of keys and begin testing them one by one. Time to get crackin'!",

But technically you could also go back to the Land of Darkness and explore any of the areas there, such as the minecarts with the gold tunnel, the river with the waterfall. The Tic Tac Toe Park. Or the other rooms in Darkness's house, like the chemistry lab or the dancing furniture. What would you like to do?",

But with that said, it wouldn't be the Savvy kid's way to proceed without exploring what mysteries and secrets could be under the closet. So I'd like to pump up my courage and face what can be behind it!\n\nAs for the rest of Land of Darkness, I think I'll make a quick run-through again once I capture darkness to see if I have missed anything or to find more valuable items that I can utilize. But for now, it's do or die for our hero. Time to gear up and see what's in that closet. Babaga-BOOSH!",

Despite the many challenges we might have faced on this adventure, you better believe that I thought of you and your unwavering courage every step of the way. And for the record, I haven't forgotten about where you guys have been. I'll pry your disappearance open like an oyster once I get home!\n\nTo everyone out there who feels scared or like they can't do something because of their beliefs. Please know that fear is just your imagination warning you to care for yourself or at the very least, it's how your body lets you know that it's challenging you to unleash and bring out your very own Solvers-Enclosure bursting in creativity, problem solving techniques, and ideas to let you make a difference. So stay strong, stay true, always be kind to others, and keep striving to make the world a better place. Babaga-BOOSH!",
